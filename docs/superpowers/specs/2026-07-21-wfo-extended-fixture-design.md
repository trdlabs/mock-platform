# Spec: WFO extended fixture — mock-platform half (items 1, 3, 5)

**Date:** 2026-07-21
**Initiative:** control-center `wfo-extended-fixture`
**Scope of this spec:** the `trading-mock-platform` items only — **3** (fixture
integrity/coverage validator), **1** (fetch + commit the 42-day T2 fixture), **5**
(code-default `MOCK_SNAPSHOT_REF` fix).

**Out of scope** (separate rollout via control-center SSOT): item 2 (SSOT tier
table), item 4 (lab/backtester consumer selection), item 6 (docs). This spec does
**not** change `ecosystem-defaults.yaml`, lab/office env, or embed T2 into the demo
image.

## Constraints (operator-set)

- The VPS fetch is **read-only**: `SELECT`/parquet reads only, no writes to the VPS.
- **No secrets printed** to logs or committed.
- The T2 fixture is committed **only after** the integrity/coverage validator passes
  in enforce mode.
- Budgets are **frozen before** the VPS probe and are never tuned to fit the data
  found. If a conforming window cannot be obtained, **stop and report a blocker** —
  do not substitute synthetic data.
- Delivery order (forced by the above): **item 3 before item 1** — the validator gate
  must exist before the T2 bundle is admitted through it.

---

## §1. Item 3 — fixture integrity / coverage validator

### 1.1 Sidecar, not a schema change

Adding a field under the manifest's `additionalProperties:false` schema would make an
old reader reject the new manifest — that is **not** additive. Instead the declared
coverage lives in a **sidecar** file next to the manifest, read **only** by the CI
validator. `snapshot.1`, `src/contract/snapshot/schema.ts`, `manifest.ts`,
`src/snapshot/loader.ts`, and `compat.ts` are **untouched**. The loader reads a fixed
set of files (`manifest.json`, `checksums.json`, the bundle); an extra
`coverage.json` in the directory is ignored by the runtime entirely.

```
data/snapshots/wfo/<ref>/coverage.json      # declared; read ONLY by verify_fixtures.ts
```

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": "fixture-coverage.1",
  "period":  { "fromMs": <int>, "toMs": <int> },   // half-open, both % 60000 == 0
  "symbols": ["HUSDT", "...", "...", "...", "..."], // exactly the native-1m symbols
  "barTimeframes": ["1h", "1d"],                    // derived timeframes this fixture ships
  "totalGapBudgetMinutes":    6480,                 // 37.5d net over a 42d window
  "maxConsecutiveGapMinutes": 1440                  // no single blackout longer than 1 day
}
```

**Strict AJV schema for the sidecar** (`fixture-coverage.1`):
`additionalProperties: false`; `period.fromMs`/`period.toMs` integers, `% 60000 == 0`,
`toMs > fromMs`; `symbols` exactly **5** unique strings; `barTimeframes` a **non-empty,
unique** subset of the contract's `Timeframe` union (`1m | 5m | 15m | 1h | 4h | 1d`);
both budgets **non-negative integers**. A malformed sidecar is a hard `FAIL` (not a warn).

`rowsBySymbol` stays the native-1m source of truth and is gated by the minute
grid/gap rules below; `barTimeframes` governs only the **derived** bar surface.
Widening the timeframe set (e.g. `30m`, `2h`) starts in the **local historical-read
contract** (`src/contract/historical-read/dto.ts`): the enum here is
`Record<Timeframe, …>`-typed against that union, so the verifier fails to compile until
the union and its bucket sizes are widened together — a fixture sidecar alone can never
introduce a timeframe.

That union is **mock-local**, not shared. `@trdlabs/sdk@0.11.0` exports no `Timeframe`
type (its historical client types `timeframe` as `string`), and the SDK seam
`historical-read/dto.sdk.ts` re-exports only `CanonicalRowV2`. So this guard binds the
mock to itself, not to the platform: a widening on the SDK side would **not** break the
build here. Lifting the timeframe vocabulary into `@trdlabs/sdk` so producer and
consumers share one union is a follow-up, deliberately out of this initiative's scope.

The sidecar is not covered by `checksums.json` (which hashes the bundle). That is
acceptable: the only way to weaken the gate via the sidecar is to declare a smaller
window or a looser budget, and that change is visible and reviewable in the committed
`coverage.json` diff.

### 1.2 Anti-tautology invariant

`declared` and `actual` are produced by **different actors, in different files**, and
the comparison is never allowed to become trivially true:

- **declared** — the whole `coverage.json` — is written from the *fetch intent* (the
  chosen window, the 5 symbol names, the frozen budgets). It is **never** derived from
  bundle content. `fetch-snapshot` and `make-fixture` MUST NOT populate these values
  from what they read; the authoring tool (`make-wfo-fixture.ts`, §2.3) takes them as
  **required CLI flags**.
- **actual** — computed **only** by `verify_fixtures.ts` from `rowsBySymbol`. The
  validator only reads and compares; it never writes.

### 1.3 Gap-budget semantics (exact)

For a half-open window `[fromMs, toMs)`, expected minute count
`E = (toMs − fromMs) / 60000`.

**Unified minute grid.** The invariant is that the `minute_ts` set is **identical**
across all 5 symbols; `G` is that common set (achieved by construction at fetch time,
§2.2, and *verified* here in the committed artifact to defend against drift or hand
edits). Because the grid is shared, `present = |G|` is a single number, and every
grid point in `G` is guaranteed to carry all 5 symbols — which is exactly what
multi-symbol WFO needs.

Two **independent** limits, both applied to `G` inside the window:

- **Total gap:** `E − |G| ≤ totalGapBudgetMinutes`.
- **Max consecutive gap:** the longest **contiguous** run of missing minutes
  `≤ maxConsecutiveGapMinutes`. Window edges count as runs:
  - leading run `= (G[0] − fromMs) / 60000`
  - trailing run `= (toMs − 60000 − G[last]) / 60000`
  - internal run between adjacent `G[i] < G[i+1]` `= (G[i+1] − G[i]) / 60000 − 1`

`totalGapBudgetMinutes = 6480` encodes "≥ 37.5 days of data in a 42-day window"
(`E = 60480`, floor `54000`). `maxConsecutiveGapMinutes = 1440` means a single
one-day blackout is tolerated but nothing longer. Both are stored as **concrete
integers** in the sidecar; the "37.5d / 1 day" rationale lives only in this spec, not
in code.

### 1.4 Corruption gate — no silent normalization

`present = |G|` is only meaningful once the rows are known clean. Before computing
`G`, the validator **fails separately** (distinct diagnostic per case) on, for each
declared symbol's `rowsBySymbol[sym]`:

- any `minute_ts % 60000 != 0` (misaligned),
- any duplicate `(symbol, minute_ts)`,
- any violation of strict ascending `minute_ts` order.

The validator is self-contained — it does not assume the loader or bundle schema
already guarantees these.

**Where those guarantees come from.** The raw VPS parquet does *not* satisfy them: it
contains same-minute re-writes (measured 2026-06-01..07-20: 1431 over 21,630,730 rows,
from the schema_version=1→2 migration and a platform update that back-filled writes), and
its date partitions are read in filesystem order. The authoring tool therefore resolves
both **before** writing a fixture — one row per `(symbol, minute)` sorted ascending — under
an explicitly asymmetric policy:

- identical repeat → collapsed;
- repeat differing only in derived metrics (open interest, funding, taker flows,
  `schema_version`) → last writer wins, counted into `provenance.json`;
- repeat differing in a **price** field (`open`/`high`/`low`/`close`/`volume`/`turnover`),
  or in any field belonging to neither list → **fatal**, no fixture is produced.

This keeps normalization at the authoring boundary where it is recorded, and keeps the
validator's rules above as genuine assertions about the committed artifact rather than as
things the writer merely intends.

### 1.5 Check order (fail-safe)

Structural validity is checked **before** touching row data, so a missing declared
symbol yields a clean diagnostic `FAIL` rather than a technical exception:

1. **sidecar schema** (`fixture-coverage.1`, AJV) valid;
2. **symbols set**: `sorted(declared.symbols) == sorted(keys(rowsBySymbol))` — exact
   equality; and each declared symbol's `rowsBySymbol[sym]` is **present and non-empty**.
   A bars-only fixture (no `rowsBySymbol` keys) that declares coverage fails here;
3. **corruption gate** (§1.4) per symbol;
4. **unified grid**: `minute_ts` sets identical across all 5 → `G`;
5. **window containment**: every `g ∈ G` is in `[fromMs, toMs)`;
6. **total gap** ≤ `totalGapBudgetMinutes`;
7. **max consecutive gap** (edge-inclusive) ≤ `maxConsecutiveGapMinutes`;
8. **derived surfaces** (§1.5.1) — only once steps 2–7 pass, since every rule there is
   "agrees with the rows" and rows already rejected would report as endless disagreement.

Any failed step → non-zero exit with a specific message.

### 1.5.1 Derived-surface gate

`rowsBySymbol` is the source; everything else in `historical` is a function of it, and
each is checked against the rows the fixture actually ships:

- `fundingBySymbol` / `openInterestBySymbol` / `liquidationsBySymbol`: no undeclared
  symbol, no entry outside `[fromMs, toMs)`;
- `barsBySymbolAndTimeframe`: for **each declared symbol**, the key set must equal
  `barTimeframes` **exactly** — a missing timeframe and an extra one are both `FAIL`.
  The set is driven by the sidecar, never by the bundle: iterating what the bundle
  happens to contain means deleting a symbol, a timeframe, or the whole surface leaves
  nothing to disagree with, and the gate passes by having no work to do.
- For each declared timeframe, every bucket is **rebuilt from the minute rows** (open of
  the first minute, close of the last, high/low extremes, volume summed) and compared on
  **all five OHLCV fields**. Volume alone let a bar carry wrong prices whenever the sizes
  still added up.
- Bar `tsMs` must be **unique and strictly increasing**. Bars are matched to buckets by
  `tsMs`, so a repeated bucket agrees on every field and passes twice over.
- Every bucket that has shipped rows must have a bar, and every bar must have rows.

### 1.6 Warn / enforce policy and scan roots

- A fixture directory **with** `coverage.json` → **enforce**: any deviation is a
  non-zero exit.
- A fixture directory **without** `coverage.json` — policy is **per root**, not global:
  - under `data/snapshots/fixtures/*` (predates the sidecar) → one
    `WARN (legacy — no declared coverage)` line, exit 0;
  - under `data/snapshots/wfo/*` (exists only for coverage-declaring tiers) → **FAIL**.
    Otherwise deleting `coverage.json` would remove the admission policy along with the
    thing it admits, turning the gate green.

`verify_fixtures.ts` scans **exactly two explicit roots** —
`data/snapshots/fixtures/*` and `data/snapshots/wfo/*` — **not** `data/snapshots/**`,
so it never picks up temporary or raw VPS refs left elsewhere under `data/snapshots/`.

**Placement:** new `scripts/verify_fixtures.ts`, added to `check:ci` after
`verify:no-secrets`. Pure comparator functions are unit-tested (§4).

---

## §2. Item 1 — fetch + commit the 42-day T2 fixture

Five steps; no VPS write; the fixture is committed only at the end, only if green.

**Probe window (fixed).** All VPS reads — the ranking aggregate and the raw pull — use
one window: the **50 full UTC days** `[probeFrom, probeTo)`, where
`probeTo = start_of(latest_complete_UTC_day + 1)` and
`probeFrom = probeTo − 50·86400·1000`. It is recorded verbatim in provenance, so the
ranking, the pull, and the chosen 42-day sub-window are all reproducible. 50 ≥ 42 gives
the slack to slide the anchor (§2.2).

### 2.1 One read-only VPS visit; everything else is local

`fetch-snapshot`'s `rsync` already downloads **all** symbols' parquet for the requested
dates (it does not filter parquet by `--symbols`). We exploit that to keep the pull to a
single visit and avoid ever materialising a 50-day all-symbol JSON bundle (a RAM/disk
blow-up):

1. **One read-only visit** pulls ops (Postgres) and `rsync`s all parquet for the 50-day
   probe window into the local parquet cache. This produces a tiny throwaway `_raw`
   snapshot for the primary symbol only (ops + `HUSDT` historical).
2. **Ranking is a local column aggregate** over the cached parquet — only the `symbol`,
   `close`, `volume` columns are read; turnover `= Σ close·volume` per symbol. `HUSDT`
   is the primary; the top-4 **excluding HUSDT** by turnover, ties `symbol ASC`, complete
   the set. If the cached parquet is missing/empty → **blocker** (no proxy fallback).
3. **The 5-symbol raw snapshot is built locally** from the cached parquet (full rows for
   only those 5) merged with the ops from step 1 — no second visit.

This keeps one visit, the original 5-symbol scope, and bounded RAM/disk.

### 2.2 Window selection + intersection (local, offline)

- **Window:** span is **exactly 42 days**; the only freedom is the anchor.
  `toMs = start_of(latest_complete_UTC_day + 1)`, `fromMs = toMs − 42·86400·1000`.
  Slide the anchor from the freshest day backwards to the first whose **intersected
  grid** passes **both** frozen budgets (§1.3) for all 5 symbols. First match wins;
  none → **blocker**.
- **Intersection:** `rowsBySymbol[sym]` is filtered to the common grid
  `G = ⋂ minute_ts` within `[fromMs, toMs)`, for all 5 symbols. The grid invariant
  then holds by construction.
- **Bars:** `barsBySymbolAndTimeframe` is **re-derived** from the intersected rows for
  exactly the timeframes `--bar-timeframes` names (default `1h,1d`), not filtered from
  the source. Filtering leaves the exporter's pre-dedupe aggregation intact, so a
  re-written minute stays double-counted in its bucket; deriving makes every bar equal
  the rows the fixture ships and puts it inside the window by construction. The same flag
  populates `coverage.barTimeframes`, so a fixture cannot ship a set other than the one
  the gate will hold it to.

### 2.3 Authoring — sidecars from intent (local)

New `scripts/make-wfo-fixture.ts` reads the raw local source fixture and produces the
aligned committed fixture. It takes as **required flags**: `--symbols`, `--from`,
`--to`, `--total-gap-budget`, `--max-consecutive-gap`; plus optional
`--bar-timeframes` (default `1h,1d`). It:

- writes the aligned bundle via the existing `writeSnapshot` path (manifest +
  checksums, gzip when raw > 90 MiB — expected here);
- writes `coverage.json` **from those flags** — never from the produced bundle (this is
  the §1.2 invariant made structural);
- writes `provenance.json` (§2.4).

### 2.4 Provenance (`provenance.json`, descriptive sidecar, not a gate input)

Records enough to reproduce the selection and trimming and to distinguish
"absent on the VPS" from "intentional trimming". Per symbol, the attrition chain is
split so the probe-surplus drop is **not** confused with VPS absence (`E` is the
selected-window minute count `(toMs − fromMs)/60000`):

- `rawRowsInProbeWindow` — rows the VPS returned over the 50-day `[probeFrom, probeTo)`;
- `rowsInSelectedWindowBeforeIntersection` — rows inside the chosen 42-day `[fromMs, toMs)`;
- `missingMinutesInSelectedWindow` = `E − rowsInSelectedWindowBeforeIntersection` —
  genuine VPS absence inside the WFO window (this, not the probe surplus, is the
  data-quality signal);
- `droppedOutsideSelectedWindow` = `rawRowsInProbeWindow − rowsInSelectedWindowBeforeIntersection`
  — the 8-day probe surplus removed by windowing (expected, not absence);
- `finalRowsAfterIntersection` — rows kept on the common grid `G`;
- `droppedByIntersection` = `rowsInSelectedWindowBeforeIntersection − finalRowsAfterIntersection`
  — rows dropped because another symbol lacked that minute.

Plus: `note` (rows filtered to the intersection of the 5 source series); `|G|` and the
chosen `[fromMs, toMs)`; the ranking source and **tie-break algorithm** (`top-4 by
summed 1m turnover, excl. HUSDT, ties by symbol ASC`); the **raw source ref** and the
**sha256 of its raw (pre-gzip) bundle bytes**.

### 2.5 Validate → commit

`verify:fixtures` in enforce mode on the T2 fixture must be **green**; `pnpm check:ci`
green. Only then commit: bundle + `manifest.json` + `checksums.json` + `coverage.json`
+ `provenance.json`, at `data/snapshots/wfo/<from>-to-<to>-vps-wfo42d/`.

### 2.6 Where T2 lives — image stays unchanged

The Dockerfile does `COPY data/snapshots/fixtures` only, so committing T2 under
`data/snapshots/wfo/` keeps the **T2 payload out of the image** (the card's "default
image does not grow" acceptance gate — see §4 for the exact assertions). The ref is
`wfo/<...>-vps-wfo42d`,
resolved relative to `MOCK_SNAPSHOT_DIR` (`./data/snapshots`). Embedding T2 into an
image is deferred to the separate rollout (card rollout step 4).

---

## §3. Item 5 — code-default `MOCK_SNAPSHOT_REF` (independent)

- `src/access/config.ts:34`: default `'fixtures/2026-06-16-synthetic'` →
  `'fixtures/2026-06-22-to-2026-06-28-vps'` — the **T1 SSOT default** (native 1m, 26
  symbols), **not** T2. This aligns the hardcoded fallback with the already-established
  SSOT default; it does not change `ecosystem-defaults.yaml`.
- mock `.env.example`: same swap.
- **Verify at implementation:** any test that builds config with empty env and relies
  on the synthetic/bars-only default; the README note from `mock-contract-parity`
  ("starting without an explicit ref yields `minute_rows_unavailable`") becomes false
  and must be updated.
- **Cost:** `pnpm dev` / Docker with no env now loads the 21 MB gz T1 fixture (already
  in the image) into RAM instead of the 32 KB synthetic one — which is the point:
  removing the bars-only-default footgun.

---

## §4. Testing and gates

- **Unit test** for `verify_fixtures.ts` (pure comparator), modelled on
  `test/scripts/no-forbidden-deps.test.ts` — happy path **and every fail mode**:
  malformed sidecar schema, symbol-set mismatch, missing/empty symbol, bars-only,
  duplicate `minute_ts`, misaligned `minute_ts`, non-strict-increasing, non-identical
  grids, total-gap over budget, consecutive-gap over budget, edge-gap over budget.
  - **window containment** as its own case: a row at `fromMs − 60000` fails; a row at
    exactly `toMs` fails (half-open upper bound);
  - **boundary pairs** for both budgets: `gap == budget` passes, `budget + 1` fails
    (total-gap and max-consecutive-gap each).
- **Runtime smoke:** `openSnapshot(rootDir, "wfo/<ref>")` resolves and loads the T2
  fixture — proving the nested ref addresses locally.
- **Docker check (inverse), three assertions** (new code may shift the runtime image a
  little, so *not* exact total-size equality):
  - `data/snapshots/wfo` is **absent** from the built image (`docker run … ls` / layer
    inspection);
  - the T2 bundle payload appears in **no** layer;
  - no image-size growth on the order of the T2 payload (~20 MB) versus `origin/main`.
- **CI:** `verify:fixtures` runs in `check:ci`; legacy `fixtures/*` WARN (exit 0), a
  `wfo/*` dir without a sidecar FAILs, T2 enforces green. Full `pnpm check:ci` green.

## §5. Error handling / stop conditions

- VPS ranking aggregate unavailable → **blocker**, stop (no proxy fallback).
- No 42-day anchor passes both budgets for all 5 symbols → **blocker**, stop (no budget
  tuning, no synthetic substitution).
- Validator FAIL on the produced T2 → do **not** commit; investigate and re-run.

## §6. Non-goals

No manifest schema / loader / compat changes. No `snapshot.2`. No ecosystem-default,
lab/office env, SSOT tier table, or consumer-selection changes. No embedding of T2 in
any image. No changes to the existing coverage-less fixtures (they stay coverage-less
and WARN).

## §7. Rollback

- Item 3 is **not** independent once T2 exists: T2's committed `coverage.json` needs a
  mandatory admission/drift gate. So the order is **remove T2 first (or keep
  `verify:fixtures`)**, and only then may the validator be dropped from `check:ci`. With
  no `coverage.json` and no `wfo/` tier, `verify:fixtures` is a no-op (every legacy
  fixture WARNs), so leaving it in place is the safe default.
- Item 1: remove the `data/snapshots/wfo/<ref>/` directory; nothing runtime depends on
  it (selection is explicit and out of scope here).
- Item 5: revert the two one-line default swaps; independent of items 1/3.
